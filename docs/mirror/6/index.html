    <p class="setup">Choice architecture is a well-studied field. The options you see, the order they appear, the defaults that are pre-selected—all of these shape choices more than conscious deliberation. AI supercharges this: it learns which architectures work on you.

Defaults are powerful. Most people accept defaults. AI recommendations are framed as &#39;suggestions,&#39; but they function as defaults: they&#39;re the easiest path, and deviation requires effort. Over time, the path of least resistance becomes the only path you remember exists.</p>
    <p class="punchline">Your choices are still yours. But the menu was written for you, personally, by a system that knows what you&#39;ll order.</p>
