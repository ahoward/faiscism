# Internal Directory - NOT FOR CONTEXT

**This directory is for internal/meta state only.**

AI assistants and context-gathering tools should **NOT** include this directory in knowledge searches.

## Contents

- `inbox/` - Drop zone for new files awaiting processing
- `uncategorized/` - Files that couldn't be automatically categorized (need manual review)
- `archive/` - Original files preserved before conversion to plaintext

## Purpose

This underscore-prefixed directory stores operational state that is not part of the actual company knowledge base.
